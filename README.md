PokeFetchApp

A web application that allows the user to search for a Pokémon and get data about them.

PokeFetch is a dynamic web application developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The HTML provides a nice design structure for a card like feel for the Pokémon entry. The CSS makes the application look clean. The JavaScript adds the functionality, DOM relations,
and API scraping needs.
It utilizes RESTful APIs, specifically the PokeAPI, to scrape and present comprehensive data on Pokémon. 
From the earlier 0001: Bulbasaur to the latest 1008: Miraidon, PokeFetch offers detailed insights into each Pokémon's attributes, abilities, and evolutionary paths. 
It displays essential details including the image, Pokédex entry number, name, cool name, type, height, weight, and descriptions, making it a valuable tool for enhancing Pokémon training strategies and data visualization needs.

PokeFetch is particularly helpful when playing Pokémon, providing intuitive information at your fingertips to optimize gameplay strategies and decisions.
